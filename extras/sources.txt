Scoring:
Must clear 15 lines to progress to the second level.
After the first level, it takes 15 * current level * 5
to progress to each next level. If the hard drop key is
used, the player receives the number of rows the piece
moves down * 5 points. One point is also given when the 
current piece is frozen.

Each time the current piece moves down is worth 1 point.
Clearing a line and progressing to a new level is worth 
current_level * 40 points.
